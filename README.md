## My process
I started out with using grid, it worked out perfectly but for some reason which i did not know then the footer appear on top of it in mobile mode. That's because the `<footer>` was `position: absolute;` but i was too late before i realized, so i changed and decided to use Flexbox which was a headache. But then went for another method. Overall it was a fun and tough challenge. But I still have problems with the text on the graphic design and the photography image. I doesnt stay at one place. I've tried to minimize the damage it causes but i would want it to be better. I also used a little bit of JS to make the mobile-menu button interactive.
